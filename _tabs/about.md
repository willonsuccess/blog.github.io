# 👋 Hi, I’m Will

A lifelong learner, bookworm, and content creator passionate about extracting powerful ideas from great books and turning them into practical insights.

This blog is where I share deep reviews, concise summaries, and reflections on books that have expanded my thinking — from technology and productivity to psychology, leadership, and even a touch of quantum physics. Whether you want to dive into timeless classics or uncover hidden gems, my goal is to make the best ideas from the bookshelf more accessible and applicable to real life.

I break books down into:

- **Summaries** — Concise and digestible takeaways of key ideas  
- **Insights** — Personal reflections and how I apply concepts in everyday life  
- **Thematic Guides** — Curated book lists on topics like decision-making, innovation, and systems thinking
