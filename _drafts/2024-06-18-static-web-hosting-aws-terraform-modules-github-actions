Immerse yourself in a detailed, six-part tutorial series that simplifies the process of automating cloud infrastructure deployment and website hosting with Terraform, GitHub Actions, and AWS. This series is designed to walk you through a progressive build-up of your web hosting environment, showcasing advanced DevOps techniques for setting up a secure, scalable, and efficient web hosting environment. Learn to:
- Code infrastructure with Terraform
- Automate deployment and updates with GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Utilize AWS for a robust web hosting solution
- The CI/CD pipeline covers infrastructure deployment, S3 file syncing, and CloudFront cache invalidation. 

Throughout the series, you’ll adopt a modular approach, where you’ll be hands-on in creating Terraform modules for:
- S3 Remote Backend
- DNS settings with Route 53 & AWS ACM
- S3 Website Hosting
- CloudFront distribution

## Objectives

1. **Initialize GitHub Repository and Local Setup:**

   - Set up a development environment with Visual Studio Code after cloning the GitHub repository to my local workstation.

2. **Terraform Remote Backend Setup:**

   - Configured a remote backend on AWS using a custom Terraform module, involving resources like an IAM user, S3 bucket, and DynamoDB table.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions:**

   - Automated infrastructure deployment through a GitHub Actions pipeline, triggered by git push events.

4. **DNS and SSL Certificate Management Module:**

   - Managed DNS with AWS Route 53 and automated SSL certificate provisioning with AWS Certificate Manager.

5. **AWS S3 Static Website Hosting Module:**

   - Set up an AWS S3 bucket to serve a static website, managing the bucket creation, versioning, and public access configurations.

6. **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement for S3 Sync:**

   - Updated the CI/CD pipeline to include a job for synchronizing website files to the S3 bucket.

7. **AWS CloudFront Distribution Module for S3:**

   - Created a CloudFront distribution for the S3 bucket to deliver content globally, with optimized distribution settings.

8. **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement for CloudFront Cache Invalidation:**

   - Enhanced the pipeline to invalidate the CloudFront cache whenever the S3 bucket is synchronized.

9. **Live Website Update:**
   - Commits to the repository trigger the automated pipeline, syncing changes to the S3 bucket and invalidating the CloudFront cache, reflecting updates on the live website.

## AWS Well-Architected Framework Alignment

This project aligns with the AWS Well-Architected Framework, ensuring best practices across the following pillars:

- **Operational Excellence:** CI/CD pipelines facilitate automated deployments and iterative improvements.
- **Security:** AWS IAM, Certificate Manager, and S3 bucket policies provide secure access management and data encryption.
- **Reliability:** AWS S3, DynamoDB, and Route 53 enhance system availability and fault tolerance.
- **Performance Efficiency:** AWS CloudFront ensures efficient content delivery with low latency.
- **Cost Optimization:** Precise resource provisioning through Terraform minimizes costs.
- **Sustainability:** Automation and efficient AWS services reduce the environmental impact.

> Whenever you make changes to your website, simply update your content and commit the changes to your repository. The CI/CD pipeline, integrated into this Terraform-managed infrastructure, automatically kicks in. It syncs the new content to the S3 bucket and triggers a CloudFront cache invalidation, ensuring that your website reflects the latest updates promptly.
